# google-homepage
This is AJ's project of a replica of Google's homepage.
This project is part of The Odin Project's lists of activities.
The project is not 100% accurate but gives a general sense of the original Google homepage. Some noticeable differences are font style, size, and footer texts are not links. Also, the search element is different.
